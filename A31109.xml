            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>THere is no Duty whatſoever which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles of our Lord doe more earneſtly exhort and preſs men to upon all occaſions than that of <hi>Unity, Love</hi> and <hi>Peace.</hi> If they had not done ſo, they had certainly departed from the great and chief Inſtruction which their Maſter gave them. For he left it as his dying Command to all his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:46459:4"/>(being ſhortly to be offer'd up upon the Croſs) that they ſhould <hi>love one another as he had loved them, Joh.</hi> 13.34. Yea, he would have their Love to each other to be ſo remarkable and viſible to all thoſe that obſerv'd their Behaviour, that by it they might be known to be Chriſtians, and diſtinguiſh'd from men of any other Religion whatſoever. <hi>By this ſhall all men know that ye are my Diſciples, if ye have love one to another, Joh.</hi> 12.35.</p>
            <p>It is no wonder then to find St. <hi>Paul</hi> both here in my Text, and in many other places, very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly perſwading to the Practice of this Duty. For though he convers'd not with our Saviour upon Earth, yet he taught the ſame Doctrine with the reſt. And here he expreſſes his own particular, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern and care over the Church at <hi>Philippi</hi> to which he wrote, and how much he ſhould be pleas'd and ſatisfied and contented, if they would but comply with him in this thing: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Fulfill ye my joy.</hi> He was glad that the Goſpel had been planted amongſt them, and of their conſtancy in the Profeſſion of it. And, as he tells them in the beginning of this Epiſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.3, 5. he <hi>thanked God upon every remembrance of them, for their fellowſhip in the Goſpel from the firſt day until then, hoping that he which had begun a good work among them, would alſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:46459:4"/>it.</hi> But this was wanting to the fullneſs and completion of his Joy, that they ſhould more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly comply with that great Precept of the Goſpel, The abounding in Love toward each other. To this therefore he conjures them with all imaginable earneſtneſs in my Text, and the Verſe before it: <hi>If there be therefore any conſolation in Chriſt, if any comfort of love, if any fellowſhip of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies: Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be like minded, having the ſame love, being of one accord, of one mind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In ſpeaking to which laſt words, I ſhal Firſt a little explain them, ſhewing you what is the Duty that is required in them. And in the next place I ſhal proceed to ſpeak concerning the Means of performing this Duty, and then of the Motives that ſhould engage us to it.</p>
            <p>I begin with a brief Explication of the Words. In which you ſee there are ſeveral Expreſſions all ſeeming to imply much the ſame thing. <hi>That ye be like minded, having the ſame love, being of one accord, of one mind.</hi> Doubtleſs the meaning of all theſe in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral is much one; That there ſhould be Unity and Love and Peace amongſt them. Yet there may be ſome little difference obſerved in the ſence of theſe expreſſions, and that more in the Original than in our Tranſlation of them. In the Greek it
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:46459:5"/>is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>that ye be like-minded,</hi> as we render it, or rather that ye all mind one and the ſame thing. And this doubtleſs all Chriſtians, as ſuch, are obliged to, to ſeek one and the ſame end, to have the ſame grand buſineſs and deſign carrying on, the promoting of Gods Glory, the common intereſt of their Religion and their own Salvation. Things always neceſſarily connected together, ſo that in ſeeking one we ſeek them all. And theſe no queſtion but all Chriſtians ought to ſeek, and that in the firſt place, as the main and chief thing they have to look after, before all the inferior con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of this Life, which in their reſpective parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Callings they may be oblig'd in a ſubordinate manner to take care of too. And to do this is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (the laſt of thoſe Expreſſions which is here us'd in the end of the verſe) <hi>to be of one mind,</hi> or rather, to mind one thing. Though 'tis true either of theſe phraſes may alſo ſignifie the being of the ſame Judgment and Opinion. And that is alſo a Chriſtian Duty, taken with ſome Limitations and Reſtrictions, for abſolutely and in the largeſt ſence it is not, becauſe 'tis a thing impoſſible. Nay I cannot ſay that it is a thing deſirable that there ſhould be a perfect Unity in Opinion, and that all mens apprehenſions ſhould be juſt the ſame; I am
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:46459:5"/>ſure it is not poſſible in the preſent ſtate of the World, conſidering the vaſt diverſity that there is in Mens Parts and Tempers and Educations with other Circumſtances.</p>
            <p>But Firſt, It is neceſſary that Chriſtians ſhould agree and be of the ſame mind in all the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals of their Religion, elſe they were not Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, if they did not ſo.</p>
            <p>Secondly, 'Tis highly fit and convenient alſo that they agree in all weighty points, all ſuch eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially whereon Practice and a good Chriſtian Life do depend.</p>
            <p>Yea, Thirdly, In all points of Religion though of leſſer moment, 'tis neceſſary they ſhould endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to agree, and joyn together as much as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and that none ſhould ſeek a difference out of a deſire to be ſingular, or be glad and proud of Diſſenting from his Brethren, for that's a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Temper.</p>
            <p>And Fourthly, Where there cannot be an exact Harmony in Opinion, there ought however to be Agreement in Love and Affection. And then the Sting of all ſuch Differences is taken out. And that's the thing intimated in the two middle phraſes, <hi>having the ſame love, and being of one accord,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:46459:6"/>the Greek. As if they were to have all but one Soul among them.</p>
            <p>And thus you ſee what is the Unity which the Apoſtle exhorts to; an agreement in ſeeking the ſame common end; an agreement in Judgment and Opinion in all neceſſary and weighty points; an agreement alſo in Opinion in leſſer matters, as far as may be, at leaſt that there be no wilful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement, and conſequently an external agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Practice, in the ſame way and manner of Worſhipping God, and Celebrating Religious Duties, as far as that can be attain'd: And laſtly, above all, a unity of Affection, which ought to prevail above all the little differences that will ariſe, and to cover them, as much as may be.</p>
            <p>And now having ſeen what the Duty is, The next Enquiry is, By what means a man may beſt be enabled to practice it, or how this Unity may beſt be promoted. And here I ſhall not go about to preſcribe any means in particular for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing of Unity to this Church or Nation, by any new Regulation of Affairs; that is not my buſineſs. But foraſmuch as the great thing that is moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, is that Mens minds ſhould be well diſpos'd toward uniting and ſincerely deſirous of it, and if
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:46459:6"/>that were once ſo, other more particular means of attaining it could not long be wanting. I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore endeavour to ſhew you what Temper all Chriſtians ought to be of, in order to the promot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Unity among them, and where, as I take it, the great defect is, that hinders it from being attain'd, as it is by all good Men deſir'd; and for this I need not look far: For the firſt thing that offers it ſelf is, That all ought to have a zealous concern for the vital and ſubſtantial parts of their Religion, which is the thing our Apoſtle may be ſuppos'd to intimate in the Text when he requires them <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>to mind the ſame thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the ſecond and third things neceſſary are plainly told us in the two Verſes next following my Text, <hi>viz.</hi> Humility and a Publick Spirit. For ſo the words are at the third and fourth Verſes of this Chapter. <hi>Let nothing be done through ſtrife or vain-glory, but in lowlineſs of mind let each eſteem o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther better than themſelves. Look not every man on his own things, but every man alſo on the things of others.</hi> So that St. <hi>Paul</hi> has not onely told us our Duty of being at Unity among our ſelves, but has alſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected us to the beſt means of performing it. And,</p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:46459:7"/>
            <p>Firſt, I ſay 'tis highly neceſſary that every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſhould have a warm and zealous concern for the vital and ſubſtantial parts of his Religion. And if there were this generally amongſt us, we may venture to ſay, that there would not be half that Contention and Diſagreement about ſmall matters that there is or has been. For he that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands rightly the worth and excellency of true Religion, and accordingly employs his moſt ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Thoughts about it, will have but little Zeal to ſpare for matters that are circumſtantial or indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, farther then as the ordering them one way or other may have a tendency to promote Piety and the General Good. And therefore ſuch a one will be of a Temper very yielding and compliant in ſuch little things whenſoever the Peace of the Church and the Publick Intereſt of Religion ſhall ſeem to require it. Secure him but that, and he will not ſtand with you for little matters of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, nor quarrel becauſe every thing is not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd ſo as in his private judgment he would have thought beſt, ſo long as nothing is requir'd of him but what he may ſubmit to without Sin. Such a one will no more ſpend his Zeal upon a Trifle, than a man would charge the whole force of his
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:46459:7"/>Arm upon the throwing out of a Feather. It is the proper Genius of a little narrow ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Soul, to be very eagerly bent upon ſome of thoſe little things which true Religion conſiſts not in: But he who has that Manly Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that largeneſs of Mind, which the Chriſtian Religion, rightly underſtood, is apt to beget in us, is of a very different Spirit. The thing he propoſes to himſelf is the Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Happineſs of another World, and his buſineſs is a due preparation for that, by living in the Love and Fear of God, and doing all the good he can to his Neighbour. This is that he is zealous and earneſt for, and all things elſe are but ſubordinate to this, and are valued but according as they more or leſs conduce to it. For as every Man in his Trade and Buſineſs, if he be Wiſe, will look after the moſt neceſſary things firſt, and never purſue Trifles to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of them; ſo 'tis the ſame in the caſe of Religion: He that do's truly ſeek in the firſt place the Kingdom of God, (which the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>conſiſts not in meats and drinks, but in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and peace and joy in the Holy Ghoſt</hi>) will be concerned for inferiour things no farther than
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:46459:8"/>as they have a tendency to that main End. And the doing thus therefore would certainly be one of the beſt means to promote Unity and take away Diviſions; which can hardly be great and laſting where true and ſerious Piety does prevail. For that cuts off the Cauſes of them; It mortifies and kills the Root, which is ungovern'd Paſſion, and a Carnal and Senſual Mind. So St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Corinthians, Whereas there is among you envy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſtrife and diviſion, are ye not carnal,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3. And to the ſame effect St. <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks: <hi>From whence come Wars and Fightings among you, come they not hence, even of your luſts that war in your members?</hi> Jam. 4.1. They are from a want of that ſerious ſence of Religion which ſhould bridle and ſubdue ſuch irregular Motions. There is therefore</p>
            <p>Secondly, A very Excellent Virtue highly conducive to Unity and Peace, which St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us all Chriſtians ſhould be clothed with, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.5. and which our Apoſtle recommends in the Verſe next to my Text, and that is Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility. <hi>Let nothing be done through ſtrife or vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory, but in lowlineſs of mind let each-eſteem other bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than themſelves.</hi> This advice if we could
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:46459:8"/>perſwade Men to take it, would certainly be a moſt Excellent Cure of our Diviſions. For <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>Onely from pride cometh contention,</hi> Prov. 13.10. It is ſo common a Cauſe of it, that there is hardly any ſtrife or quarrelling where there is not a mixture of Pride, on the one ſide or on the other, or perhaps on both. Pride makes men inflexible and unyield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; never willing to acknowledge a Fault, though it have been never ſo plain, nor any the leaſt Error in their Conduct, though Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Men ſee it eaſily. Yea Pride makes Men think very highly of their own Merits; and it aggravates the Injuries that have been done them, as if they could never ſufficiently be recompenſed. It tempts Men to a Retaliation of Wrongs that have been done to them; a thing as oppoſite as poſſible to the true Spirit of a Chriſtian. Yea it oft-times leads them to ſuch extremities as in the end prove deſtructive to themſelves. And thus do Proud Men find a way of perpetuating Quarrels, which a little Humility would quickly bury in Oblivion. Men that have a high opinion of themſelves would fain have it thought that they were always in
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:46459:9"/>the right, and will hardly make any allowances for the Circumſtances of others. But alas! as there is none but what is ſubject to many Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, nor no man but what has his Faults, ſo I am ſure there is no Party among us but what has been greatly diſgraced by ſome or other of its Members, and has divers whom it ought to be aſhamed of. We have liv'd in times when Men of ill Principles have had ſo fair an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of ſhewing them, that they could very hardly forbear it; and ſome have done it to purpoſe. But better all theſe things were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, than that they ſhould create any thing of a bitter ſpirit among Men, or that the faults of a few ſhould be imputed to a whole Party, or to any more indeed than what have plainly made themſelves guilty of them. It was the Advice of <hi>Cicero</hi> to the <hi>Roman</hi> Senate upon a great Revolution, to <hi>forget what had been paſſed, and what miſdemeanours many had been guilty of, and to look forward.</hi> And to this purpoſe, (ſayes he) I brought in a <hi>Greek</hi> Word among them, us'd of old in a like caſe by the <hi>Athenians;</hi> that was <hi>Amneſty,</hi> or an Act of Oblivion, which he would have perſwaded them to make of what was paſt.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:46459:9"/>If a Heathen could adviſe ſo well out of Love to his Countrey, I am ſure much more it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a Chriſtian; Love being the very genius of the Goſpel, and forgiving Injuries the moſt neceſſary Duty. And it is the part of Wiſe Men rather to look forward how things may beſt be rectified and amended for the future, than backward for the puniſhing of all Offenders. And this brings me to the</p>
            <p>Third Thing I mentioned as a Neceſſary Means of Uniting, and that is a Publick Spirit, or a real preferring the Publick Good before any Private Intereſt; even as St. <hi>Paul</hi> here en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns at the fourth Verſe, <hi>Look not every man on his own things, but every man alſo on the things of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi> We have many Examples of this (of a Publick Spirit, and great Love to their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey) among the Heathens, particularly in the Hiſtories of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Athens;</hi> and I think I may ſay there was never any Kingdom or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth that was great, but what was made ſo, by its breeding ſome Men in it that were very remarkable for this Virtue. When God by his Providence has deſign'd good to a People, he has rais'd up ſome amongſt them who have had
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:46459:10"/>both the Skill, the Ability and Opportunity, and alſo a ſtrong Inclination to do good to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and to become Publick Benefactors; and who accordingly have ſhew'd a wonderful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry and Zeal and Courage both in attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and effecting it. And this certainly is a moſt Generous and Noble Temper, deſerving, yea extorting the higheſt Praiſe and Commendation from all that have any ſence of what true Worth and Virtue is. But ſordid and mean Spirits are they who confine their thoughts to their own narrow Sphere, whoſe Intereſt is altogether pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, and who as our Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Look onely on their own things, and not on the things of others. Ut quiſ<expan>

So far as a man reſpects nothing but his own private Profit and Advantage in what he does, ſo far he is not a good Man. If Natural Reaſon could teach a Man this, I am ſure Chriſtianity does it much more. For St. <hi>John</hi> requires that Chriſtians in ſome Caſes ſhould be ready to lay down their Lives for the Brethren, for the common Intereſt of their Religion and of their Fellow-Chriſtians. Are thy likely to do ſo think you, who will not
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:46459:10"/>ſacrifice a little pique or private Reſentment, or a groundleſs fancy, or ſome ſmall conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of their own to the Publick Utility? But St. <hi>Paul</hi> when he is predicting perilous times that were a coming, tells us, <hi>that men ſhall be lovers of their own ſelves,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.2.</p>
            <p>The Truth is, if we conſider the baſe ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, which the moſt Publick Spirits, and greateſt Lovers of their Countrey have often met with (of which there are inſtances enough in Hiſtory) it may ſeem enough to deter Men, and cauſe them to abate of their Zeal in that kind. And it is the more to be wondred at that there ſhould be ſo many inſtances of this Virtue among the Heathens. But there are theſe things to be conſidered;</p>
            <p n="1">1. That to a Generous Nature there is a great delight, pleaſure and ſatisfaction in doing good to others, eſpecially to a great many. Whatever Reward a Man meet with for it, it is in ſome ſort a Reward to it ſelf.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Though many may be ingrateful, yet it is to be hoped that all will not, and whatever miſ-repreſentations Envy and Ill-will may make
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:46459:11"/>of a Mans beſt Actions, yet ſome will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand better and be more ſenſible, and a good Man may be content with the Approbation of a few. But,</p>
            <p n="3">3. To a Chriſtian the great thing is a Reward in Heaven, which God who enjoyns this Duty, will certainly beſtow upon the performers of it.</p>
            <p>Now if men had but this Principle in them, of conſidering the caſe of others as well as their own, and valuing the common Good before their own private Advantage, there is nothing could more conduce to Unity. and Peace. It would cauſe them to overlook many little things which elſe would be great Obſtructions, and bear with any tolerable inconvenience in order to ſo great a Good.</p>
            <p>And now having ſhewed you the Duty toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with that Temper of Mind which is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to diſpoſe men to the performance of it; (<hi>viz.</hi> A ſerious ſence of Religion, and a fervent Zeal for the more weighty matters of it; the Virtue of Humility and a Love of the Publick) I proceed next to ſpeak concerning the motives to it, and to urge ſuch Arguments as ſeem moſt
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:46459:11"/>proper to encline us all, at this time eſpecially, in our ſeveral places to labour after Unity and Peace. And</p>
            <p n="1">1. The great and general motive which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per at all times, is, That this is a moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and neceſſary Chriſtian Duty ſtrictly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd and requir'd by our Saviour, who came to make Peace between God and Man, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced them bleſſed <hi>who are Peace-makers</hi> among Men on Earth. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.9. It is a Duty ſo often preſſed in the Goſpels and in the Epiſtles that we may be ſure it will never be diſpenſed with; and in what degree they are bleſſed who are the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Inſtruments of making Peace, in the ſame muſt they be eſteem'd accurſed who are the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors or Promoters of any cauſeleſs Diviſions in the Church of Chriſt. The beauty and ſtrength of any Society depends upon the firm Union of its Members; and therefore the ſeeking after and promoting this, is what every one that loves the Society muſt and will do. And though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times through miſtake even very good men may have become Authors or Occaſions of Diviſion; yet he is an Enemy to Chriſt and his Kingdom that is wilfully ſo, whatever Intereſt he may ſerve
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:46459:12"/>by it; and he cannot be eſteem'd any Friend to either, that is not ready to the beſt of his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and ability to cloſe the Differences, and cement the unhappy Breaches that are among Chriſtians. 'Tis too eaſie from our own Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience to obſerve the many miſchiefs that they cauſe, and the great advantage which the Devil makes of them, in the encreaſe of Prophaneneſs and Irreligion among ſome, the ſcandalizing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and too much diverting the Minds even of the beſt from the moſt ſerious and weighty mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. But the Benefits of Unity, and Miſchiefs of Diviſion are too many to be comprized in a ſhort Diſcourſe. He that ſeriouſly conſiders them may be quickly ſatisfied that it was not for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that our Saviour and his Diſciples do ſo frequently and earneſtly perſwade and require Chriſtians by all means to follow after the things that make for Peace, and to be at Unity among themſelves. But</p>
            <p n="2">2. It does more particularly at this time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern us as far as poſſible, to wipe off the Scandal which our Adverſaries of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are alwayes ready to caſt upon us, that we want the neceſſary Means of Unity, and that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:46459:12"/>for us ever to have it without ſubmitting our ſelves to an Infallible Guide. 'Tis true, 'tis very diſingenuouſly done to uſe ſuch baſe Arts and ſo much Induſtry as it is certain they have done, to ſow Diviſions and foment them amongſt us, and then to upbraid us with them. 'Tis true alſo that 'tis better for us to bear with all thoſe Inconveniences which our Differences may cauſe, than to ſeek ſuch a Remedy from them as they do, by ſetting up an Officer with Supream Authority, and vainly pretended Infallibility in the Church to whom Chriſt has never given any ſuch power or Commiſſion, and which is worſe, by che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing the groſſeſt Ignorance in the People, and exerciſing the moſt Barbarous Cruelties and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanities toward all that dare to contradict them. Better we ſhould differ ſtill, and diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree as much as ever, than that we ſhould uſe any ſuch wicked Methods of compoſing or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting Differences; even as 'tis better to live in a Government that is ſometimes liable to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbances, than to throw ones ſelf into perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Slavery under an Arbitrary Power. But though all this be true, yet ſtill it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd that there is nothing that the Papiſts have
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:46459:13"/>ever made greater advantage of, both in the gaining Proſelytes from us, and doing other Miſchiefs to us, than thoſe cauſeleſs and unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Diviſions that are among us. And no doubt they would now exceedingly Triumph, if after ſo great a Baffle to their long-laid Plots as thro' Gods wonderful Mercy, they have met with, they could prevail ſo far as to Embroil us all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and hinder us from reaping the Fruit of ſo Happy a Deliverance. But as I think we have reaſon to impute it much to the influence that they have had amongſt us, that our Diviſions have been ſo many and continued ſo long with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Cure; ſo I do not deſpair to ſee the day when many of them ſhall be happily laid aſleep, and all ſober Proteſtants though under ſome dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent apprehenſions, may yet maintain ſo much Unity and Charity among themſelves as will be both an Ornament to their Profeſſion, and a great ſtrengthening to their Cauſe. O how happy would it be if when Infallibility it ſelf cannot (as we ſee) or dares not put an end to thoſe fierce Diſputes that are in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but the Kingdom of Antichriſt is divided againſt it ſelf notwithſtanding all the Devils Policy to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:46459:13"/>Unite it, if in the mean time, I ſay, a Spirit of mutual Love and Concord and good Will might prevail and cover over all our Differences. But</p>
            <p n="3">3. A third Motive to perſwade us at this time eſpecially to labour after Unity and Peace and to promote them all we can, is a ſence of Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and Thankfulneſs to Almighty God for the great things that he has done for us. Certainly it is a very ill return that we ſhould make to God if when he has delivered us from our Enemies, we ſhould fall preſently to quarrel among our ſelves, and inſtead of joyning in our Praiſes and Thankſgiving unto him, bring our ſelves by our own Folly into new Troubles. How un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy ſhall we then ſhew our ſelves of Gods future Mercies, and how juſtly may he ſuffer us to fall under the moſt heavy Judgments. It is, as has bin ſhew'd, the prime Duty of Chriſtians to Love one another, and to keep Peace and Unity among themſelves. And now that God has in ſo ſignal a manner engag'd us to it, it will be a great Aggravation of our Fault if we neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect it. It is very hard indeed for us to ſet a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient value on the Deliverance we have had; there are Circumſtances in it that render it very
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:46459:14"/>aſtoniſhing and wonderful, above all that this Nation has ever had. That it ſhould be brought about without Blood (or with ſo very little) in ſo ſudden and ſurprizing a manner, that we may ſay with the <hi>Pſalmiſt, When the Lord turn'd again the captivity of his people, then were we like unto them that dream:</hi> Pſal. 126.1. We could hardly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that we were awake. That the Hearts of ſo many Men of different Intereſts and Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, through Gods wonderful working on them, ſhould all ſtand enclin'd the ſame way. And that they who had had ſo long Time and Means and Opportunities to make themſelves ſtrong, could yet do nothing to oppoſe. Theſe and ſuch like Circumſtances in our Caſe are things that every one eaſily thinks of and none can ſufficiently admire. Certainly it is a loud and gracious Call from Heaven to Reformation, and a mutual joyning together againſt the great Corrupters of Chriſtianity, who hop'd to have Extirpated the very Name of <hi>Proteſtantiſm, i. e.</hi> of True Primitive Chriſtianity from out of the World. This Kingdom had indeed a Hundred Years ago a very great Deliverance. And if the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Deſigns had then prevail'd, we might
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:46459:14"/>have been brought into as bad a Condition as Popery and Slavery can put Men. But then I think that Deſign was never ſo likely to take effect, as thoſe of our Enemies in this Age. And as for the <hi>Gunpowder Treaſon,</hi> though it might have done a great deal of Miſchief, yet I cannot ſee that ever it was likely to have prevail'd to a total overthrow of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> among us; but rather might have fallen heavieſt at laſt on thoſe that began it. But our <hi>Popiſh Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> had now got ſuch an Opportunity as they could hardly ever have expected. It was—<hi>quod optanti Divum promittere nemo Auderet;</hi> Virg. A thing which none of their Saints could ever have promiſed them. And they were vigorouſly making uſe of it. They had taught a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny among us who ſeem'd unwilling to learn, and very loth to apprehend it, what kind of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Popery</hi> is. They had diſplay'd themſelves in their own proper Colours, and convinc'd us by all ſorts of proof that they were in earneſt. We could not reaſonably doubt of their Intentions to Model us after the ſad Example of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Countrey. And they had their Tools and Inſtruments of all ſorts among us to work out
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:46459:15"/>their Ends; making ſuch uſe of our Diviſions as is of it ſelf a good ground of ſuſpition that they had a hand in the firſt hatching them: When be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold on a ſudden God who had ſet them their Bounds and determin'd how far they ſhould go and no farther, put ſuch an unexpected ſtop to them as ought to fill us with Joy and Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs. But then it becomes us to expreſs our Thankfulneſs, by making a good Uſe of ſo great a Mercy. And I am ſure we cannot better expreſs it, than by rendring Praiſe to Him whoſe work it is; by loving one another, and joyning toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Chriſtian Unity and Concord, and by forſaking thoſe Crying Sins which have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd God ſo long to hold the Rod over us, and to threaten us ſo ſeverely; and which it is to be fear'd if ſo great Mercy as this will not lead us to Repentance muſt end in our final and irrevocable Deſtruction. But</p>
            <p n="4">4. And laſtly, We ought to conſider, that the onely way to compleat our Wiſhes, and to procure a happy ſettlement to this Church and Nation, the only thing whereby we can ſhew our ſelves ſerious and ſincere Chriſtians, true Lovers of our Religion and of our Countrey, is
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:46459:15"/>by ſtriving to our Power to promote Unity and Charity, Love and Good Will. We can never be ſo ſettled, but that if Men have a Diſpoſition to be peeviſh and contentious, they may always find ſome matter to work upon. Neither is it poſſible that all things ſhould be ſo well order'd, but that there will be ſomewhat left to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd of, and ſomewhat ſtill that may need farther Amendment.</p>
            <p>The ſtate of Men in this World admits not of Perfection, neither is any Government free from its Inconveniences. But one would think we might learn by what we have felt, and what we have fear'd, to be content now with mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate things, to be glad our greateſt Danger through Gods great Mercy is over, if we bring it not again upon our ſelves, that we may now enjoy our Religion with ſafety in our own Countrey, and not be put to thoſe ſevere Trials that many of our Neighbours have endur'd. For the reſt we may very well commit the ordering of it to God and to thoſe whom his Providence has ſet over us, reſolving not to murmur at eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing that does not juſt pleaſe our own Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies or anſwer our Expectations. Let us learn
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:46459:16"/>well the Leſſons I before inſiſted on, which are the proper means of uniting us. Let us be Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and Earneſt for the greateſt Matters of all, the Vitals and Eſſentials of our Religion; and let us ſhew that we are ſo by our agreeable Practice, endeavouring what in us lies to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage Virtue and Piety by a good Example, and to put Vice out of Countenance by our open diſapproving it. And let none propoſe Schemes of Imaginary Happineſs to himſelf in this World, which is but a paſſage to a better, and not a place of Reſt, a Wilderneſs and not our <hi>Canaan.</hi> Let us beware however of murmuring in it, or of provoking God by our Unthankfulneſs to turn a Bleſſing into a Curſe. Let every one endeavour ſeriouſly to be of a meek and lowly Mind, a Humble and Charitable Diſpoſition, anſwering the Character which the Scripture ſo often gives us of a good Man and a true Diſciple of Chriſt. Let none make too bitter Reflections upon the paſt Miſcarriages of others, or cenſure any too hardly for what themſelves under the like Circumſtances might perhaps have done. In fine, Let us all be willing to ſacrifice private Reſentments to Publick Good, to forgive as
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:46459:16"/>becomes Chriſtians any that have done us wrong, and to joyn with one Heart and one Mind in promoting the Glory of God and the Common Intereſt of our Religion. <hi>Let us follow after the things that make for peace, and things whereby one may edifie another, Rom.</hi> 14.19. So ſhall the joy of every good Chriſtian be fulfilled and compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And ſo may we all happily enjoy that great Bleſſing which the wonderful Providence of God has beſtow'd upon us, and the happy effects of it may reach to our lateſt Poſterity. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with that Apoſtolical Exhortation in the Third of the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> 12, 13, 14, 15. <hi>verſes. Put on therefore (as the Elect of God holy and beloved) bowels of mercy, kindneſs, humbleneſs of mind, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, long-ſuffering; Forbearing one another and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving one another, if any man have a quarrel againſt any, even as Chriſt forgave you, ſo alſo do ye. And above all theſe things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectneſs. And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which alſo ye are called in one body and be ye thankful.</hi>
